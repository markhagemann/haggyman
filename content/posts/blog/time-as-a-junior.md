Imposter syndrome is real, but it's entirely understandable to feel that way when you start out. Having the feeling
that you don't know enough, will likely end up motivating you to become a much better developer.
It also means that you feel you have a lot to learn from your colleagues, which is an excellent
position to be in.

## Ask questions without asking the same question again

As a junior you're expected to ask questions and it would probably raise concern if you weren't.
When asking the question, try to fully grasp it so that you don't need to ask it again, otherwise write it
down for later use. When you're told that something is best practice - find out why and don't be afraid to
question it. Without people questioning best practices we wouldn't end up with things such as [React](https://reactjs.org)
and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind).

## Code reviews help... a lot

The importance of having someone review your code cannot be repeated enough.

1. It reduces bugs in production and catches out errors / typos
2. You're less likely to submit code you're not proud of
3. Helps with consistency and legibility
4. Helps share knowledge

Don't take criticism of your code as criticism of you personally. You stand to gain a lot more by
allowing others to review your code, regardless of whether you completely agree with their comments.

## Aim to be a specialist first

Being a generalist is very useful and impressive but if you start a job that requires you
to work on PHP frameworks such as WordPress or Laravel - aim to become very comfortable
and confident in that realm before worrying too much about learning the next hot javascript framework.
In saying that, anything that helps motivate you to develop your programming skills outside of your day job
is highly encouraged.

## There are great resources and tools out there to help

1. Podcasts such as [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/) is one of my favourites and they cover very relevant topics
2. Learning resources such as [Udemy](https://udemy.com), [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
3. Meetups through websites such as [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com) as well as conferences
