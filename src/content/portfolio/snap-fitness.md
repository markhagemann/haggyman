### About

Snap Fitness is a health and fitness club franchise with over 2500 locations around the world.

### Goals

- Combine 12+ websites for different countries with different languages into one multilingual site
- Simple way to share and update common content across multiple country pages and child pages
- Ability to share blog posts from one country onto another
- Migrate all relevant data from legacy sites
- Handle redirects from all legacy sites
- Provide in-depth franchising information

### Tools used

SilverStripe 4, MySQL, Webpack, SASS, and jQuery

### My learnings

- Code structure to support faux subsites
- The benefits of SASS such as variables, mixins, nested syntax and file joining
- Google translate API
- IP detection to notify user of content specific to their location
