### About

Insurgence is a 24 hour functional group training fitness franchise that allows members to workout whenever they like. They provide a new functional based workout each day with workouts that start every 3 minutes.

### Goals

- Provide brand awareness
- Generate trial conversions with the potential of memberships
- Generate interest from potential franchisees

### Tools used

SilverStripe 4, MySQL, Webpack, SASS, and jQuery

### My learnings

- Using flexbox provides answers to previously tricky CSS questions
- Webpack hot reloading to improve local development speed
- The benefits of SASS such as variables, mixins, nested syntax and file joining
