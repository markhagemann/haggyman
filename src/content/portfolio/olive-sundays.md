### About

Olive Sundays is a Melbourne food blog where you can search great places to eat in Melbourne.

### Goals

- Modernise the site with its own custom built theme
- Improve the sidebar features
- Add more custom pages with unique requirements

### Tools used

WordPress, Elementor, and MySQL

### My learnings

- General freelance experience
- Ability to build a site without any mockups, only hand-drawn wireframes
- Creating a colour scheme appropriate to the branding
- Elementor is an excellent choice for allowing non-technical users to update content
- Deployment through Bluehost
